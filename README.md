# Clickbait Analysis Project

For this assignment (submitted to my Fall 2021 Machine Learning for the Social Sciences course), I take data that consists of headlines signifying clickbait or not. I then vectorize the clickbait headline column into an X matrix, and run three separate 5-fold cross-validated logistic regression models with different tokenization approaches. The model with the highest score was the logistic regression using the Stemmer tokenizer, with an accuracy score of 97.6%.
